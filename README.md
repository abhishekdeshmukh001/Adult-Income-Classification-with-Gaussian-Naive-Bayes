## Title: Adult Income Classification with Gaussian Naive Bayes

### A. Description:
This project focuses on classifying individuals' income levels, specifically predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year. It utilizes the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, evaluates its performance, and includes the calculation and visualization of various classification metrics.

### B. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes such as age, workclass, education, occupation, native country, etc.
We will be using the following dataset:

      adult.csv

## -Tasks Performed:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, if any.
* Explored the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of features.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Model Implementation:
* Implemented the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm using appropriate libraries or frameworks.

### 3. Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier in several ways, including:
* Fitting the model to the training data.
* Making predictions on the test data.
* Creating a confusion matrix to assess model performance.
* Visualizing the confusion matrix to provide an intuitive representation of results.

### 4. Classification Metrics Calculation:
Computed various classification metrics to assess the classifier's performance, including:
* Accuracy
* Error rate
* Precision
* Recall
* True Positive Rate (TPR or Sensitivity)
* False Positive Rate (FPR)
* Specificity
And more, depending on the specific requirements.

### 5. Class Probabilities:
* Calculated class probabilities for the predictions made by the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.

### 6. Histogram of Predicted Probabilities:
* Plotted a histogram of the predicted probabilities, providing insights into the distribution of predictions.

### 7. ROC Curve:
* Created an ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve to visualize the classifier's performance in predicting salaries.

### 8. Cross-Validation:
* Conducted k-Fold Cross Validation with 10 folds to obtain a robust assessment of the classifier's performance.
* Calculated the average cross-validation score to gauge the model's consistency.
